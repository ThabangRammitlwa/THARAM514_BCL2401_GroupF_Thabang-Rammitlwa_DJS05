# DJS05 Project Brief: Building a Redux-Inspired Store for a Tally App

In this challenge, you will venture into the realm of state management by constructing a Redux-inspired store to manage the state of a simple Tally App. Your primary goal is to manage the app's state changes efficiently, focusing on core functionalities like incrementing, decrementing, and resetting a counter. Instead of rendering changes on the UI, you'll subscribe to state updates and log them to the console, highlighting the power of state management in applications.

## Objective
Create a minimalistic, Redux-inspired store to manage and log the state of a counting Tally App. Your implementation will not involve UI rendering; instead, it will use console logs to demonstrate state management effectively.

## User Stories (Gherkin Syntax)
Your challenge will encompass the following scenarios, tested through your store's implementation:

### SCENARIO 1: Initial State Verification
```
GIVEN no interactions have been performed yet
WHEN the “getState” method is run
AND the result is logged to the console
AND the browser console is open
THEN the state should show a count of 0
```

### SCENARIO 2: Incrementing the Counter
```
GIVEN no interactions have been performed yet
WHEN an “ADD” action is dispatched
AND another “ADD” action is dispatched
AND the browser console is open
THEN the state should show a count of 2
```

### SCENARIO 3: Decrementing the Counter
```
GIVEN the current count in the state is 2
WHEN a “SUBTRACT” action is dispatched
AND the browser console is open
THEN the state should display a count of 1
```

### SCENARIO 4: Resetting the Counter
```
GIVEN the current count in the state is 1
WHEN a “RESET” action is dispatched
AND the browser console is open
THEN the state should display a count of 0
```

### Project Overview
This project shows how to construct a simple JavaScript state management system that is similarly to Redux. Developing a store, specifying a reducer, using actions to handle state transitions, and putting subscriptions to state changes into practice are all part of the project. Redux's simplified version highlights the fundamental ideas and workings that drive more deeper state management libraries.

### Learning Experience
It was enlightening and rewarding to implement a state management system from scratch that was related to Redux. My understanding of state management, immutability, and the unidirectional data flow pattern improved as a result. This report outlines the knowledge gained, difficulties faced, and abilities developed throughout this project.

### Challenge Faced
Implementing a Redux-like state management system from scratch presented several challenges. These challenges were crucial in deepening my understanding of state management principles and improving my problem-solving skills.
